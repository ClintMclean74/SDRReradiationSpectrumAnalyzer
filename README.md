The application is in the build\ folder.

Start the reradiation spectrum analyzer with launch.bat.

Run SDRSpectrumAnalyzerOpenGL.exe for these usage instructions and edit launch.bat accordingly.

Usage: SDRSpectrumAnalyzerOpenGL [-a] [-m] [-f] [-s] [-e] [-S]
	-a: Automatically detect reradiated frequency ranges
	-m: Scanning Mode [normal, sessions]
	-f: Required frames for sessions
	-s: Start frequency
	-e: End frequency
	-S: Sound cues for detecting increasing signal strengths	
	
	In Program Keys:
	
	1: Toggle data graph
	2: Toggle correlation graph (only for synchronizable devices)
	3: Toggle devices fft graphs' graphics (only for synchronizable devices)
	4: Toggle fft graph graphics (off/2D/3D)
	5: Toggle strength graph graphics (off/2D/3D)
	6: Toggle average fft graph graphics (off/2D/3D)
	7: Toggle average strength graph graphics (off/2D/3D)

	SHIFT and mouse moves graphs
	CTRL and mouse rotates graphs
	
	Left mouse button and drag on graph selects frequency range and zooms in	
	Right mouse button on graph zooms out
	
	Mouse wheel zooms in/out graphics
	
	n: Record near series data (for non-automated detection)
	f: Record far series data (for non-automated detection)
	
	SHIFT N: Clear near series data
	SHIFT F: Clear far series data
	
	e.g., SDRSpectrumAnalyzerOpenGL.exe -a -s 430000000 -e 470000000
